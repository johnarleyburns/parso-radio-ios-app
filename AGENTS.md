## Build & Test

```bash
# Regenerate Xcode project (REQUIRED after adding/removing files)
xcodegen generate

# Build
xcodebuild -project ParsoMusic.xcodeproj -scheme ParsoMusic \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16,OS=18.1' build

# Run unit tests
xcodebuild -project ParsoMusic.xcodeproj -scheme ParsoMusic \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16,OS=18.1' \
  test -only-testing:ParsoMusicTests

# Run integration tests (hits real IA APIs, slow)
xcodebuild -project ParsoMusic.xcodeproj -scheme ParsoMusic \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16,OS=18.1' \
  test -only-testing:ParsoMusicIntegrationTests
```

**Always regenerate the Xcode project (`xcodegen generate`)** after adding or removing `.swift` files — they are not automatically discovered by the build system.

## Dev Methodology (Plan → Implement, Phase by Phase)

This rigid framework governs how all non-trivial features, refactors, and structural changes are handled.

### 1. Plan to Disk First (Section by Section)
Before writing any application code or modifying existing models, you must document the architecture changes on disk:
- Write comprehensive design documents under `plans/<topic>/<date>/`.
- Structure the directory with `00-overview.md` (containing raw notes, design principles, high-level roadmap, and cross-cutting decisions), followed by dedicated files per feature area.
- Research existing web implementations, competitors, and the current codebase *before* finalizing each section. Ground every entry in the exact physical files it will touch.
- **Each design section must follow this strict anatomy**:
  $$\text{Problem} \longrightarrow \text{Current Behavior} \longrightarrow \text{Research Signal} \longrightarrow \text{Design (with ASCII mockups)} \longrightarrow \text{Data-Model Deltas} \longrightarrow \text{Implementation Steps} \longrightarrow \text{Testing Strategy} \longrightarrow \text{Open Questions}$$
- Capture every critical decision requiring developer validation in an isolated **decision sheet**. Once answered, record the result verbatim in `decisions.md`. Do not re-litigate settled items.
- Consolidate all schema deltas, database migration safety guarantees, and a **phased rollout table** (one branch and PR per phase, clearly outlining dependencies) in the final planning section.

### 2. Implement Phase by Phase (One PR Each)
Execution must move iteratively and safely:
- Before starting a phase, update `current_state.md` to track implementation velocity and structural status.
- Create a distinct git branch per phase. If a phase depends on unmerged upstream work, **stack** the branch (branch off the dependency and merge siblings in) rather than branching directly off `main` to maintain a cleanly buildable dependency chain.
- Isolate logic cleanly: Core playback states, database routines, and ingest models live inside the pure core layer (headlessly test-verifiable with `xcodebuild test`); keep SwiftUI views thin and decoupled on top.
- Schema modifications must be **additive only** (optional or defaulted fields, avoiding destructive migrations) to guarantee local database continuity.
- **Verify, then commit/push/PR**: Run local unit tests to gate the changes. If the `xcodebuild` UI/Simulator suite exhibits environment degradation (e.g., ~45s launch ballooning or `no debugger version`), clear the environment locally:
  ```bash
  killall -9 com.apple.CoreSimulator.CoreSimulatorService
  ```
- Always reference spec IDs or feature descriptors in commit headers and append the `Co-Authored-By` trailer when appropriate.

### 3. Close Out Completed Plans
Once implementation of a planned phase is done, use the same closeout flow every time:
- Re-read the original plan and compare it against the implementation, including touched files, data-model changes, UI behavior, tests, and open questions.
- Fix any discrepancies between the plan and implementation before declaring the phase complete. If the implementation intentionally diverged, record the reason in the plan or status docs.
- Update `current_state.md` with the actual current state, completed work, known gaps, verification results, and next phase pointers.
- Update `README.md` when the completed work changes the project’s user-facing behavior, setup flow, architecture overview, or operational status.
- After verification and documentation updates are complete, commit the finished phase, merge it to `main`, and push `main` so the remote pipeline reflects the current project state.

## Architecture Rules

### Curation Architecture (DO NOT REGRESS)

```
  INSTALL/UPDATE (one-time)
    per-channel JSON → import to SQLite tracks table
    (tagged with channel-stamp isolation tokens)

  RUNTIME (ongoing)
    Channel.matches() → filters SQLite tracks table by stamp
                      → QueueManager reads from filtered pool

  SHARE (one-time)
    Export: DB track data → JSON/CSV
    Import: JSON file → parse → insert/update tracks → reload()
```

### NEVER:
- Write to per-channel JSON files from track fetch or verdict methods.
- Delete tracks without a channel filter during `pruneChannelTracks()`.
- Delete tracks in `evictOldTracks()` that are in active channels.

**The SQLite database is the sole source of truth for track data. JSON files are reserved exclusively for static assets and import/export flows.**

---

## Key Invariants

- **Main Actor Threading**: All ViewModels must be decorated with `@MainActor`.
- **Thread-Safe Storage**: All database access must pass through a dedicated serial `DispatchQueue`, bridged asynchronously via `withCheckedContinuation`.
- **State Propagation**: `currentChannel` MUST remain an explicit `@Published` property — do not revert it to a plain variable.
- **Race Protection**: Use a `playbackContextToken` to invalidate stale `playTrack` calls during rapid skipping or track backtracking.
- **Database Integrity**: The `curationCounts()` operation must explicitly `JOIN` the tracks table to exclude orphaned rows.
- **Error Tracking**: `failedAuditionTrackId` must be mutated and set BEFORE `currentTrack` is cleared out during an audio failure lifecycle.

---

## Coding Conventions

- **Time Formats**: Leverage `Double.formattedTime` or `TimeInterval.formattedTime` for UI-facing audio durations.
- **UI Theming**: Apply styles systematically via `ChannelCategoryStyle.color(for:)`, `.gradient(for:)`, and `.icon(for:)`.
- **Component Reuse**: Render details metadata utilizing the standardized `SharedViews.infoRow(_:_:)` layout wrapper.
- **Accessibility Integration**: Accessibility is non-negotiable. Comprehensive VoiceOver labels, accessibility traits, and explicit Dynamic Type support must scale across every interface component (NFR-2).
- **Self-Documenting Principles**: Write highly semantic, clear code. Avoid inline code comments unless addressing complex algorithmic workarounds or unexpected Apple framework edge-cases.

---

## Test Patterns

- **Target Visibility**: Tests must declare `@testable import ParsoMusic`.
- **Isolated State**: Database unit testing must instantiate an isolated, in-memory engine: `try DatabaseService(path: ":memory:")`.
- **Queue Stubbing**: `QueueManager` tests must inject a custom `manifestPool` closure block to simulate curated channels deterministically.
- **Network Decoupling**: Isolate external Internet Archive service boundaries using `MockURLProtocol` (Note: this protocol configuration is static and not parallel-safe).
- **Audio Control**: Implement `FakeAudioEngine` for reliable, synchronous, and deterministic validation of audio playback control states.
- **Execution Strategy**: Because tests leveraging shared singletons may cross-contaminate state, execute test suites sequentially.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Missing Blueprint Files**: Adding a new `.swift` file without subsequently executing `xcodegen generate` will drop the file from compilation targets.
- **Alphabetical Execution**: Remember that XCTest orders and runs test execution cases strictly alphabetically.
- **Initialization Signatures**:
  - `Track` struct init: `partNumber` must precede `parentIdentifier`.
  - `Channel` struct init: `category` must precede `icon`; `preferredSource` must precede `feedURL`.
- **Asynchronous Time Flags**: `AVPlayer` time observers execute on an internal timer loop rather than audio processing progress — zero-valued ticks do NOT provide positive confirmation of active audio playback.
- **Idempotency**: `importBundledCurationsIfNeeded` must strictly fire a single time per channel life-cycle.

---

## Git Workflow

- **Continuous Integration**: Pushing directly to `main` executes the remote pipeline (Unit Tests $\rightarrow$ Integration Tests $\rightarrow$ TestFlight deployment).
- **Local Verification Gate**: A strict local **pre-push hook** handles unit tests and forces failure termination before allowing code pushes upstream.
- **Pre-Push Routine**: Always run your assertions locally before executing git push commands to protect build pipelines:
  ```bash
  xcodegen generate
  xcodebuild test -project ParsoMusic.xcodeproj -scheme ParsoMusic \
    -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' \
    -only-testing:ParsoMusicTests
  ```
- **Remote Origin**: `git@github.com:johnarleyburns/parso-radio-ios-app.git`
- **Pipeline Health Check**: Query current execution state via: `gh run list --limit 1 --branch main`

## Regression Contract

Before claiming any feature/fix is implemented, verify these invariants hold:

### Music For You
- Section always mounts (no `if showSection` gate in `MadeForYouSection`)
- Header always renders as a plain `Text("Music For You")` (no icon, default section-header font), matching peer Home sections
- Section visible in all states; shows the previous picks while a refresh runs in the background — the "Finding…" spinner appears only on the genuine first-ever load with no prior picks
- "Books for You" renders directly below "Music For You"
- Returns MUSIC ONLY — never LibriVox audiobooks, podcasts, or lectures (enforced query-side: music-only recs + no `librivoxaudio` cold-start query)
- Existing-user play history backfills taste profile once (check `tasteProfileBackfillVersion`)
- Cold-start fallback returns music picks, never hides section
- Refreshes on every play (`playHistoryVersion` change); a persisted per-shelf snapshot (`madeForYou.snapshot.music`) survives relaunch so previous picks render immediately, then a background refresh swaps in fresh picks and never clobbers good picks with an empty/spinner state. Day-keyed daily cache is still written.

### Books for You
- Same store/format as Music For You (`MadeForYouShelfStore(shelf: .books)`, horizontal card shelf, plain header, always mounts; shows previous picks while refreshing)
- Returns AUDIOBOOKS ONLY (spoken-only recs + `librivoxaudio` cold-start query)
- Tapping a card plays the whole book (`fetchTracksForIdentifier` → `playAlbumTracks`)
- Daily cache namespaced separately from Music For You (`books:<day>` key); the last-shown snapshot is namespaced too (`madeForYou.snapshot.books`) so the two shelves never collide

### Player Surface
- `NowPlayingSheet` uses `playerVM.activeMediaKind`, never `currentChannel?.mediaKind ?? .music`
- `PlaybackContext` set in every entry point (channel, playlist, direct, search, audition)
- Books for You / audiobook paths set mediaKind explicitly
- Every finite non-ambient surface renders scrub slider, elapsed time, remaining time
- Audiobook/lecture surfaces render work-level time left
- The Album / Chapters / Episodes buttons NEVER stop or change playback: they set `playerVM.surfaceListRequest`, which dismisses the full player (the mini player stays, audio keeps playing) and presents the list at the root (`RootTabView`). ONLY tapping a row changes playback; `didSelectFromSurfaceList()` then re-opens the full player (`shouldPresentNowPlaying`). `ItemDetailView(autoPlayOnLoad: false)` must NOT auto-play when opened from the surface.

### MP3-Only Audio Policy
- All IA audio selection paths use `MP3AudioFormatSelector` (MP3 Layer 3 / VBR MP3 / `.mp3`)
- No Ogg, FLAC, M4A, AAC, Opus, WAV, SHN in any playback selector
- Bundled ambient WAV files exempt (local offline fallback)

### Chapter De-duplication
- `InternetArchiveService.fetchTracksForIdentifier` (and `itemInfo`) collapse multiple MP3 bitrate variants of the same chapter to ONE entry (highest bitrate: 320>256>192>VBR>128>64), so chapters are never listed 2×/3×
- `PlayerViewModel.partsAreClean` rejects part-sets with duplicate chapter keys; `dedupeParts` repairs stale tripled DB rows offline (and self-heals the DB in `WholeItemController.resolveItemParts`)

### Jump Back In Works
- `track_play_history` persists the play's `media_kind` (additive column); legacy null rows fall back to `Track.inferredMediaKind`
- `fetchRecentlyPlayedWorks` collapses EVERY multi-part work — audiobook/lecture/podcast chapters AND music album tracks — under their shared `parentIdentifier` into ONE work card held at the most-recently-played track's position; only standalone tracks (no `parentIdentifier`) and ambient stay per-card
- Tapping a book/lecture/podcast card resumes the WHOLE work from its saved position via a STABLE `album:<parentIdentifier>` playlist key (never a random UUID)
- Tapping a music album card resumes the EXACT track you last played from that album (the representative track) at its saved position — or that track's start if it was finished / has no saved position — then continues the album (`RecentlyPlayedController.resumeMusicAlbum`)
- A chapter and a music track are never conflated: `RecentlyPlayedController` must not derive kind via `mediaKind(in: nil)`; resume context uses the persisted/work media kind so the right surface (audiobook vs music) renders

### Search Favorites
- The book/album detail sheet (`ItemDetailView`) exposes a working favorite toggle (`itemdetail.favorite`); search result rows expose a swipe-to-favorite action
- `playSearchResult` takes an authoritative `mediaKind` (derived from the result collection) and never hardcodes `.music`

### Verification Gate
- Before commit: `xcodegen generate` if files added/removed
- Before push: full `ParsoMusicTests` gate must pass
- Source guards in `RegressionContractSourceTests` must not fail on fixed patterns
- UI changes require targeted UI test or simulator screenshot evidence
- UI tests seed deterministic state via the `-uiTestSeed` launch argument (`UITestSupport`, DEBUG-only)
